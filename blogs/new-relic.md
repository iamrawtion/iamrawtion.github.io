I received a mail some months ago to register to New Relic, they had some cool offers then like free t-shirts etc. I didn't check it then as i was really busy with other stuff. However since my new DevOps learning experience and course material had mentions of monitoring tools, after googling a bit i came across New Relic too.  
  
So New Relic is a software analytics company. It delivers a Saas)Software as a service) model, that monitors Web and Mobile application real-time. Monitoring using New Relic seemed easy as i tried it on one or two systems and the logs generated looked really accurate and helpful too.  
  
While there are may other useful ways as well for any organization for monitoring using New Relic, i only tried it for a systems performance. You can monitor your app, by simply supplying a a config file to the project directory and compiling and deploying the project. New Relic will provide real-time updates of the resources used by the app. You can add many plugins to your New Relic dashboard and enhance your monitoring experience.  
  
**Installation**  
  

- Installation on windows was simple as you just have to download New Relic executable from their website. free trial is available.
- After installing New Relic Server monitor. Log in to your New Relic account (Create one if you did not create.) You can see you dashboard.
- Click on Dashboard and click on Add more. It will pull up the list of compatible Operating systems along with instructions to go ahead with monitoring.
- It is important to note that their is a unique key supplied on this page for the monitoring to show any progress or logs in the system.


**Configuring**

- The configuration only involves copying the key to the New Relic Server monitor on your windows machine
- Go to Start > Programs > New Relic Server Monitor > Configure copy the key to the space provided.
- If you are using any proxy then you can add more details in the proxy tab


**Start Service**

- Once the required configuration has been done, just click on start service and start monitoring in you Dashboard in the web interface.


You can see Pie Charts, Graphs of total memory used by process, total memory free, disk space, network usage etc. Screenshots are attached. Happy Monitoring.
