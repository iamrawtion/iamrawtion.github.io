For the 2nd **DevSecOps** meetup, we already had our first swag sponsor. For **DevOps** Pune, I received swags from **Docker** and **Ansible**. Hashicorp was also planning to send a few.  
  
With **DevSecOps** our 1st swag sponsor was [Polyverse](**https**://polyverse.io/) :) I couldn't resist posting these.

For this meetup, I changed the RSVP format to get an exact count. I was expecting to start soon at a bigger location. We couldn't risk wasting of resources. Lean coffee needs logistics to take care of and hence needs to be addressed really well. Everyone who RSVP' at the meetup page was informed to Call/SMS/WhatsApp the organizers to book a slot. So the Meetup page RSVP meant nothing.

[Qualys](**https**://www.qualys.com/) Pune, was our venue, logistics and refreshment sponsor this time. When I 1st told them about the meetup, this is how the they arranged the seating :) :

```

  
  
  
  

I told them about the format and later we changed the seating to best suit the format.

We had 12 RSVP and 10 attendees this time with just 1 last minute informed cancellation. That was a perfect number . We also made sure that the refreshment we take was a packed and long lasting one so we don't waste food.

With 10 attendees we stared pretty much on time and this time we had a huge list to discuss and the participants were from mixed domains unlike last meetup. This time we had QAs, Support Engineers, **DevOps**, Consultants and Developers altogether.

The following topics got discussed:

- Understanding PKI - Public Key Infra (How **SSL** Works?)
- CIS Benchmarking
- SOAR (Security, Orchestration, Automation and Response)
- **AWS** Compliance
- Securing serverless in **Azure** (Function as a Service)
- Debian **Linux** and Contributing to it
- Microservices with an example


**SSL** and PKI got discussed a lot since [Muneeb Shaikh](**https**://www.linkedin.com/in/nixmaniack/) really explained concepts that we were unaware of that goes behind PKI formation and how public and private keys work. A 5 minutes discussion prolonged to a good long 30 minutes with inputs from everyone.  
  
SOAR was a new process and concept that Rahul spoke about and worth reading for everyone. CIS compliance was a hit one this time too. We understood that it was topic worth presentation hence added to the **DevOps** Pune meetups Agenda. Later we spoke about **AWS** compliance and how Prowler could be used to ensure compliance in AWS. We also discussed importance of good naming conventions and Tagging in AWS. There was a chaos when we spoke about both serverless and microservices resulting to a debate topic that we discussed at the end of the meetup. The final closure was on Debian systems and how we would contribute to it.  
  
Takeaways from this session for speakers to prepare were:  

- PKI and **SSL** encryption
- Microservices


A few topics that did not get discussed were:  

- Types of Security and importance of each
- GRC - Governance, Risk and Compliance
- Security Testing with Selenium
- Achieving **CI/CD** with **Ansible**


This turned out to be a long event in spite of small number of attendees. Muneeb got Polyverse T-Shirt to keep PKI discussion happening and also actively participating in all other topics as well. Some others got stickers.  
  
Some clicks :)
