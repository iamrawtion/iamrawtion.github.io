A king once announced in his
kingdom, "Anyone who gets him 
something that is really unique, which no one in this world has will be
rewarded, but if its not unique, he will be hanged" A tailor came forward and
gifted him an air jacket. He said that the jacket was invisible and was made up
of air. The king proudly got up wore nothing but the jacket and proudly went on
a ride in the kingdom. No one else, but a 12 year old kid came forward laughing
out of his innocence and honesty saying "O king!! You are wearing
absolutely nothing and are roaming naked giving your kingdom a full view of
yourself." This is the end of the story. Don’t really know what happened
with the kid, but pretty sure he dint live thereafter!!! Hope everyone got the
right message….
