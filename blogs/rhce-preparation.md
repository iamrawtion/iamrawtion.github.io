4th Part KickStart Files

1.      
Automated installation using kickstart

2.      
Kickstart installations are performed based on
files that contain instructions of how the system needs to be setup

3.      
A kickstart configuration file is automatically
created by the anaconda installer at the end of the RHEL installation

4.      
This file is saved in the root user’s home
directory called Anaconda-ks.cfg

5.      
You can manually create a kickstart file
manually by the system config kickstart utility

6.      
Application > system tools > kickstart

7.      
This application is not installed by default
however its easy to get it post installation

8.      
Open kick start file to view its content

# kickstart file automatically generated by anaconda

# version = DEVEL

Install cdrom  //this means
installation media was cdrom

Network enable //network was enabled

Root password encrypted

Firewall started ssh port opened

Shadow password for authentication

Selinux—set to enforcing mode

Timezone -> set

Bootloader

Below this is hard drive and LVM layout

All are commented by ‘#’ reason being a new system requiring the file may
not have same hard drive layout

Installation repository name RHEL

Packages section have all software info ‘@’ indicates package group

‘@’ absent indicated individual package

‘-‘ indicates package excluded from install

9.      
Uncomment the drive details since we need it for
the automated install later

10.  
The system configuration kickstart file can be
used to modify existing kickstart config file as well

11.  
File > open > select anaconda-ks.cfg and
fields will be automatically filled along with partition info

12.  
Display configuration : if we do not include
directives for installing Graphical Desktop Environment than the 1st
boot service will not run after the installation has finished. In this event u
will have to manually add a user to the system. By default kickstart only
defines a root user, we can add a new user to kickstart file with ‘user’
directive

13.  
Simplest place to specify a user is right below
the root user in the kickstart file

User –name=Kenny –password=pass1234
