After some good success, a huge gap and some mixed learning experiences with organizing [DevOps Pune](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Pune/members/?op=leaders) meetups, I decided to start with [DevSecOps Pune](https://www.meetup.com/DevSecOps-Pune/members/?op=leaders) meetup. This was mainly since I was exploring possibilities in Information Security world. The idea started after seeing [DevSecOps Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-DevSecOps/) Meetup and the learning experience I had their simply by reading their updates. I saw regular posts on Facebook about this meetup group from my long time mentor [Archis Gore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/archis). I was still confused whether to start a meetup in Pune or just stick to Seattle meetup and attend it virtually. You don't always have to be an organizer to learn.  
  
However, Archis told me that the Seattle meetup could not be attended virtually, as the format could not support virtual attendance. This was a Lean Coffee format. Something different for me. On learning more about the format, it sounded really like a plan to start a similar meetup in Pune. Archis was here in Pune in October 2018, when I met him to understand the organizer's roles in this format. And then, and we were in or a great start. I got [Rahul Khengare](https://in.linkedin.com/in/rahulkhengare) with me this time as a Co-organizer and started the meetup group. [Cloudneeti](https://www.cloudneeti.com/) helped us sponsor the meetup group.  
  
The first meetup I knew would be a small one with limited attendees. I expected less than 10 attendees to show up and the RSVP count always go wrong. I remember wasting lot of food and other resources in the past due to incorrect RSVP count. I chose a location to the central Pune so that its easy to commute to everyone. Thanks to [Bobby Jadhav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbyjadhav) for sponsoring the venue, i.e [HauteBook](http://hautebook.com/)'s office.  
  
We had 5 attendees in this meetup as expected. The count was not important. What was more important was whether good topics came up. With Lean Coffee we expect every participant to come up with good topics to vote for and speak about. The topics that got discussed were:  
  

- Docker image security and its challenges (Highest voted)
- DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline with Kubernetes
- Cloud Security
- Metasploit - Kali Linux

We discussed a lot about Docker security and Snyk, Twistlock being the docker security tools were also explored further. How CIS compliance helps cloud security and the recent how engineers disable SELinux first on any system and that is a bad practice. Although just 5, the discussion went along for a huge 2 hours and it was indeed a wonderful learning experience.  
  
We also decided later that the takeaways from these lean-coffee format will end up becoming speaker-attendee format topic for us to deep dive into important topics further. This was a great takeaway since with DevOps meetups we only spoke about what the speaker was best at, and may or may not be community learning requirement. Takeaways from this session for Speakers to prepare about was:  

- CIS Compliance
- SELinux / Apparmour

These topics were added as Topics on DevOps Pune meetup and the hunt for the speaker started there. A few topics that did not get discussed due to lack of time were:  

- iptables
- Ansible, Terraform and CI/CD for pod deployments on AWS
- AWS security alternatives
- Security compliance
- Securing Nginx

Overall it was a wonderful learning experience. Cheers to all the attendees.
