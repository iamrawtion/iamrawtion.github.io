**1st day**

Our 1st day stay was an unofficial one. We reached there one day prior to the actual reporting day. There was actually nothing to do and a few teams like ours who had arrived a day before. Even though lunch and dinner arrangements were not done for the 1st day, we were directed to the college canteen, we dint go for lunch just had a light snack.
We had **rest** at noon, and evening we went to a seashore(cant call it a beach) nearby which is very much near to Amrita amma's ashram, as locals directed us there. Spent the evening near the sea shore, clicked a few pics and had fun. While returning to the hostels clicked a few pics near the huge college building which almost looked like a palace.
For dinner, we were told to go to the hostel mess, the dinner was decent enough and free although it was an official stay. The 1st day itself we got to know the rule for the college hostel students and i guess although few may not like it, but with a discipline point of view it was very much needed and good although. You are supposed to wash your own plates after the meal. This rule was only for the college students not for the guests.
After dinner had a nice walk and finally returned to the hostel, studied a bit and went to sleep

**2nd Day (THE 1ST OFFICIAL DAY)**

By the time we woke up, Many more students have had already arrived.
We woke up late lazily since there was nothing to do as such, had bath and went to hotel Amma for breakfast.

Had something new there called Omlette dosa....
:P Now we went for checking the college campus and building.
The college building is a huge palace like structure pure white in color and looks highly royal.
Looks sure like a **ICPC** centre.
The classrooms and the campus was much like any other campus.
Thereafter went for registrations met few other students there, made a few friends there among the volunteers.

Got to know few other colleges and school came from Maharashtra.
There were certain documents to be presented, the college I-Card and other stuff.
It all got wind up pretty soon.
Just wanted to go in the rooms and have **rest.
Lunch was in the college canteen.
The canteen was really big and was clean as well.
The food was awesome.
Volunteers to serve us the same.
The coordination was splendid among the volunteers.
